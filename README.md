# odin-sign-up-form

This project was created as part of The Odin Project curriculum. It involved creating a page with a sign-up form using previously learned proper HTML elements, including `fieldset`, `form`, `label`, `input`, and `button`, as well as needed atributes for the elements. A proper styling using CSS was also applied to the page, which required the usage of recently learned: CSS units, selectors, positioning and CSS functions.
